Frontend app for mystocks Finance portfolio app

## Used technologies

Used technologies:

- Flutter (Dart)
- Automatic deploy on Heroku, url: https://gentle-island-51487.herokuapp.com/
- Heroku provides free cloud usage but it has its conditions - app is asleep in case it is not used for couple of minutes. It means that when you open the app for the first time (after a while) it is very slow.
